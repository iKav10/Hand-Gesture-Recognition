# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

1.	Platform Used – Jupiter or PyCharm

2.	Python – 3.x (we used Python 3.8.8 in this project)

3.	Convert file to “.ipynb” if using Jupiter. Covert file to “.py” if using PyCharm.

4.	Files to be imported for Windows and Mac OS

•	OpenCV
•	MediaPipe
•	Numpy
•	PyAutoGUI
•	Autopy
•	Pychaw
•	Comtypes
•	Osascript

5.	First run the “HandTrackingModule” file to recognize the hand.
